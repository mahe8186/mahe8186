I am a strong believer in open source software (OSS) and have a deep interest in cyber security and privacy. I am continuously looking to broaden my understanding in these domains. Furthermore, I find the realm of Android custom ROMs fascinating and take pleasure in experimenting with flashing custom ROMs on my devices. I am enthusiastic about learning and exchanging experiences with others in these areas.
